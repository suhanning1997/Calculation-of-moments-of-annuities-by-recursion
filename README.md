# Calculation-of-moments-of-annuities-by-recursion
In this project, I present a example of calculating moments of annuities recursively, assuming random interest rates. R codes and Rnw file are provided.

The task is to calculate the present value of a series of 20 payments at the end of each year for 20 years, supposing $i_1$, $i_2$, ..., $i_n$ are IID returns, where
$i_k$ = 0.05 w.p. 0.15;
      = 0.06 w.p. 0.60; 
      = 0.07 w.p. 0.25

The recursion techinique is useful when the analytical formulae moments are hard to derive.

For more examples, please check out "more examples" file, where I provided R codes and Rnw files solving 3 extra questions.
