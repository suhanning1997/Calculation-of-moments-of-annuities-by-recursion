# Calculation-of-moments-of-annuities-by-recursion
In this project, I present a example of calculating moments annuities through recursion, assuming random interest rates. R codes and Rnw file are provided. 
For more examples, please check out "more examples" file, where I provided R codes and Rnw files solving 4 extra questions.
